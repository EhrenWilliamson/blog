LOOPING made easy

Basic Java loops,

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

The for loop is an easy loops it is executed before the code loop starts, defines a condition for running, and is executed each time after the code block has been executed. I have used it for iterating through an array.

The while loop executes as long as a condition is true. 

The do/while loop is similar to a do/while loop but will always execute the code once. This is important because it will execute the code even when the condition is false.
